              Passionate developer with expertise in building scalable web applications and creating innovative solutions. I’ve always been a problem solver at heart. As a kid I loved puzzles, solving riddles and finding patterns in things. I was drawn to anything that I could figure out. That curiosity stayed with me throughout the years guiding me as I entered into my career. Eventually that evolved into a love for good design – solving visual problems and crafting experiences that make sense at a glance. After graduating from San Diego State with a B.A. in Graphic Design, I began my career as a graphic designer. I collaborated with different companies and teams, working across branding, publications, and digital content. In 2021, I decided to take a leap to expand and challenge myself in a new way, joining a Full Stack Engineering bootcamp with Thinkful. Writing code gave me the same feeling I had as a kid solving puzzles –– that mix of curiosity, logic, and satisfaction when everything clicks. It became quickly clear that software engineering was where I wanted to grow. Now as a Front End Developer, I bring both design and engineering together. I care about details, clean interfaces, and building products where that not only works but feels good to use. In my spare time, I am usually feeding that same love of learning –– whether it’s solving Wordle, Sudoku, or crossword puzzles or diving into a good mystery novel. Of course, when I need a break from all the problem solving…I head to the gym 💪
